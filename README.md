## Description
This project is a comprehensive analysis of U.S. federal income tax brackets over the years. The goal is to visualize and understand the changes in tax rates and taxable income thresholds for different income groups, providing insights into how tax policies have evolved over time.  Features Historical Data Analysis: The project includes tax data spanning over a century, allowing for a detailed examination of trends and patterns in U.S. federal income tax brackets. Visualization: The analysis is supported by visualizations created using Python libraries such as Plotly, which help in better understanding the data. Comparison: Compare the tax burden across different income groups by analyzing the effective tax rates and the maximum taxes paid by low and high-income earners. Installation To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python installed. The project also requires several Python packages which can be installed using pip.  Prerequisites Python 3.6 or higher pandas plotly openpyxl (for working with Excel files)
Tax Bracket Analysis Report
Overview:
The dataset provided contains information on tax rates and brackets over several years. The key columns include the year, the tax rate for the bottom income bracket, the taxable income up to which this rate applies, the tax rate for the top income bracket, and the taxable income over which the top rate applies.

## Yearly Trends in Tax Brackets:
Bottom Bracket Rate:

The bottom bracket tax rate has remained consistent at 10% from 2016 to 2020.
Top Bracket Rate:

From 2016 to 2017, the top bracket rate was at 39.6%.
From 2018 onwards, it decreased to 37%.
Income Thresholds:

The taxable income for the bottom bracket has gradually increased from $18,550 in 2016 to $19,400 in 2020.
The taxable income for the top bracket has significantly increased from $466,950 in 2016 to $622,050 in 2020.

## Changes in Tax Policies:
The data shows a noticeable policy change starting in 2018, where the top bracket rate dropped from 39.6% to 37%. This change coincides with the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the United States, which was enacted in December 2017.
3. Implications of Tax Bracket Changes:
Impact on Low-Income Earners:

The stability in the bottom bracket rate (10%) over these years indicates a consistent tax burden for low-income earners. However, the slight increase in the taxable income limit means that slightly higher income earners could benefit from lower tax rates in the earlier years.
Impact on High-Income Earners:

The reduction in the top bracket rate from 39.6% to 37% and the increase in the income threshold for the top bracket from $466,950 to $622,050 potentially benefits high-income earners by reducing their overall tax liability.
## Economic Considerations:
Revenue Impact:

The reduction in the top bracket rate could lead to lower tax revenue from high-income individuals unless offset by economic growth or increased taxable income.

## Equity Concerns:
There may be concerns about equity, as reductions in top bracket rates typically benefit higher-income individuals more than lower-income individuals.
Summary Statistics
Bottom Bracket Rate %:
Range: 1% to 23%
Mean: 11.92%
Top Bracket Rate %:
Range: 7% to 94%
Mean: 56.59%
Bottom Bracket Taxable Income:
Range: $1,000 to $45,200
Mean: $10,483.49
Top Bracket Taxable Income:
Range: $29,750 to $5,000,000
Mean: $633,041.60
Trends Over the Years:
Tax Rates:

The bottom bracket rate has generally been stable at around 10% in recent years.
The top bracket rate has significantly decreased from the highs of 67% or more in the early 20th century to around 37% in recent years.
Taxable Income Thresholds:

The bottom bracket taxable income threshold has increased over time, indicating adjustments for inflation and changes in economic conditions.
The top bracket taxable income threshold has also increased significantly, reflecting changes in income distribution and tax policy.
Observations:
The spread between the top and bottom tax rates has narrowed in recent decades, with the top rates dropping substantially from their historical highs.
The taxable income thresholds for both brackets have generally increased, particularly for the top bracket, which indicates a shift in the tax burden towards higher income levels over time.
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of tax bracket trends, changes in policies, and their implications on different income groups. It highlights the broader economic considerations and offers valuable insights into the shifting landscape of tax burdens in recent years

Summary:
The tax data over the years 2016 to 2020 reflects stability in the bottom tax bracket, while significant changes in the top bracket reflect broader tax policy shifts. The changes seem to favor higher-income earners, particularly from 2018 onwards, aligning with legislative changes in U.S. tax policy.
